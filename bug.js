This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library.  When selecting multiple images, the order of the selected images in the `response.assets` array does not match the order in which they were selected by the user. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected behavior in applications that rely on the order of selected images, such as image carousels or sequential image processing workflows.
